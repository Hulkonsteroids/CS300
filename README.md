DSA: Analysis and Design <br/>
•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?<br/>
The problem I was solving for the projects in this course was to be able to read a csv file and sort the data that was contained in that file. Once the data is sorted, display the data. Also, a user can search for a specific course. <br/>
•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.<br/>
I approached the problem by using Binary Search Trees. I had to research on which data structure would be the most appropriate when handling a large amount of data, while keeping the data sorted. Also, I had to take into account the speed of each data structure too. <br/>
•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?<br/>
To help overcome some roadblocks like ensuring the data would be inserted into the binary search tree, I used the class resources. The zybook was very useful explaining the appropriate steps to traverse the tree. I also debugged the program line by line eliminating different problems progressively. <br/>
•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?<br>
My work on this project helped me think about what can cause the program to run more efficiently at a deeper level. I must think about what the most efficient way is to store data, whether it needs to be sorted, or whether it needs to be manipulated in some sort of fashion. I would need to find the best data structure for the system’s needs since each one has its pros and cons. <br/>
•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?<br/>
This project has helped me evolve the way I think about the scalability of a program. For example, I had to think about what if the data base has 100’s of different classes. It must be able to adapt to different amounts of courses. By organizing the data, it makes it easier to maintain it too. Also, it is vital to keep consistent spacing and indentation to make it as easy as possible to read.
